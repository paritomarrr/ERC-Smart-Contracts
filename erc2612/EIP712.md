# EIP-712 Deep Dive

## Section 1: Introduction to EIP-712

### Why EIP-712 Exists

In Ethereum's early days, most application logic lived entirely on-chain. Developers would write smart contracts that handled everything - from storage to business logic to user authorization - and users would interact with them by submitting transactions.

While this design was simple, it came at a cost: every action required gas.

As Ethereum adoption grew, so did  the cost of block space. Simple user actions - like voting in a DAO or approving a token transfer - became prohibitively expensive for many users.

This prompted a shift in thinking:

> What if we could separate intent from execution?

Instead of requiring users to send full transactions, developers began using signed messages to capture a user's intent off-chain. This allowed apps to:

- Batch transactions
- Let relayers pay gas on the user's behalf
- Create more flexible and user-firnedly flows

However, this transition introduced a new problem - message signing UX.

### Problems with Raw Message Signing (`eth_sign`)

In early approaches like `eth_sign`, users were asked to sign arbitrary bytes or raw hashes.
Wallets like MetaMask could not interpret the meaning of the message, so users would see vague prmpts like:

> "Do you want to sign this hash: `0xA7F..D93`"?

This was problematic for three reasons:

1. Opaque Information
Users had no idea what they were actually authorizing.

2. Phishing Risk
Malicious dApps could trick users into signing messages that led to token transfers or approvals.

3. Replay Attacks
The same signed message could be reused in different contexts, on other contracts or even on other chains.

Without structure, message signing was dangerous â€” and developers had to roll their own encoding/decoding logic, leading to inconsistent and insecure implementations.

### What EIP-712 Solves

EIP-712 was introduced to solve these issues by defining a standard for typed structured data hashing and signing.
At its core, EIP-712 provides:

1/ Human-Readable, Structured Messages
Instead of signing a hash or hex blob, users sign typed, structured messages like:

```json
"message" : {
    "from": "0x123..",
    "to": "0x456..",
    "amount": 100,
    "nonce": 1
}
```

Wallets can display this data clearly, so users know what they're signing.

2/ Type Awareness
EIP-712 messages are typed - the signer and verifier both know the expected schema.

This makes the signed message deterministic and avoids ambiguity in interpretation.

3/ Replay Protection
EIP-712 includes a domain separator with fields like:

- `name`: app name
- `version`: app version
- `chainId`: chain ID
- `verifyingContract`: the contract that will verify the signature

This prevents a signature valid for one dApp (on one chain) from being reused elsewhere.

4/ Better UX for Gasless Transactions
EIP-712 enables meta-transactions - users sign a message, and a relayer submits it on-chain, paying the gas for them.

This unlocks:

- Frictionless onboarding
- Web3-like UX
- Support for mobile apps, games and Layer 2s

EIP-712 is a key building block for innovations like:

- ERC-2612 Permit (gasless ERC-20 approvals)
- Session keys
- Account Abstraction

## Section 2: Core Concepts of EIP-712

### Typed Structured Data

At the heart of EIP-712 lies one core idea: typed structured data.
Instead of signing arbitrary bytes or strings, you sign a struct - a clearly defined object with named fields and explicit types.

**What Does "Typed" Mean?**

EIP-712 messages use type-safe definitions, just like Solidity structs. Each field must specify its type:
Example:

```solidity
string name;
uint256 amount;
address recipient;
```

In the EIP-712 spec, the data is represented in a canonical JSON-like schema, which defines:

- Field names
- Field types
- Their order

This ensures deterministic encoding - both the signer and the contract know exactly what is being signed.

**Solidity Struct vs EIP-712 Type Definition**

Here's a simple example of how a struct in Solidity maps to EIP-712's typed data:

Solidity:

```solidity
struct Payment {
    address from;
    address to;
    uint256 amount;
}
```

EIP-712 JSON-Type Schema:

```json
[
    {"name": "from", "type": "address"},
    {"name": "to", "type": "address"},
    {"name": "amount", "type": "uint256"}
]
```

This schema is used to generate a type hash a struct hash, which are combined to produce the final message digest.

### Domain Separation

One of the most critical innovations in EIP-712 is domain separation.
Without it, a signed message could be reused on a completely different dApp or chain - leading to signature replay attacks.

**What is `EIP712Domain`?**

EIP-712 introduces a special struct called `EIP712Domain`. It contains metadata about the signing context.

This fields usually include:

```solidity
EIP712Domain {
    string name;
    string version;
    uint256 chainId;
    address verifyingContract;
}
```

These fields get hashed into a domain separator, which acts like a namespace.
Changing any of them creates a different domain - making the signature invalid in other contexts.

**Why This Matters**

Without a domain separator:

- A signature on L1 could be replayed on L2
- A message intended for Protocol A could be executed on Protocol B
- Users could be tricked into signing a valid message for an attacker's contract

Domain separation ensures a unique context for every EIP-712 signature.

### Final Message Digest

Once you've constructed the typed message and the domain separator, you're ready to build the final message hash to sign or verify.
This follows the EIP-191 standard, which defines how data should be prefix-hashed before signing.

Formula:

```solidity
keccak256(
    "\x19\x01" || domainSeparator || structHash
)
```

Or in solidity:

```solidity
bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    "\x19\x01",
    DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
    structHash(message)
));
```

**Why the `"\x19\x01"` Prefix?**

This is part of EIP-191, a legacy spec that defines how data should be prepared for signing.

- `\x19` = 25 (non-ASCII escape character indicating EIP-191 data)
- `\x01` = EIP-712 specific version byte

This prefix avoids collisions with other types of signed data and ensures that wallets and tools interpret the hash correctly.

**Final Outcome**

The final digest (`digest`) is what gets passed into `ecrecover` or `ECDSA.recover` to verify the signature:

```solidity
address signer = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
```

This makes the verification secure, deterministic, and context-aware - with clear protection against replay and misuse.

**Recap: End-to-End Flow**

1/ Define types (schema for structs)
2/ Build domain separator using app metadata
3/ Hash the struct (user message)
4/ Hash entire payload using `"\x19\x01"` prefix
5/ Sign the digest off-chain or verify it on-chain

## Section 3: Signing Workflow

### High-Level Flow: End-to-End EIP-712 Message Signing

EIP-712 streamlines the process of signing structured data off-chain and verifying it on-chain.
Let's walk through the end-to-end lifecycle of an EIP-712 signature:

1. dApp Defines Schema + Domain
The dApp defines two key elements:

- Struct type - defines the data (e.g. a `Permit`, `Order`, `Greeting`, etc)
- EIP712Domain - defines the domain context (name, version, chainId, verifying contract)

These definitions are used to:

- Display human-readable data to the user
- Hash and generate a consistent digest

2. User Signs Typed Data (Off-Chain)

The frontend uses `eth_signTypedData_v4` to generate a signature.

- The wallet (e.g. Metamask) presents the message in a readable format
- The user approves it
- The signature is returned: a tuple of `(v, r, s)`

This happens off-chain, so no gas is consumed yet.

3. dApp Sends Signature + Data to Smart Contract

One the message is signed:

- the dApp packages the signed data and original message
- Sends it to a smart contract (on-chain)
- This triggers a function like `permit()`, `greet()`, or `submitOrder()`

4. Smart Contract Reconstructs the Digest

The smart contract performs two tasks:

- Rebuilds the domain separator from its own values
- Recomputes the struct hash from the message fields

Then it creates the final digest:

```solidity
digest = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "\x19\x01",
        domainSeparator,
        structHash
    )
);
```

5. Smart Contract Verifies Signature

Using the digest and the `(v, r, s)` signature, the contract verifies:

```solidity
signer = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
require(signer == expectedUser);
```

If the recovered signer matches the expected user -> the message is considered valid and authorized.
