# ERC-2612: Permit Extension for EIP-21 Signed Approvals Deep Dive

## Introduction

### Motivation Behind ERC-2612
ERC-2612 was introduced to address one of the biggest usability pain points of ERC-20 tokens: the need for a two-step process to interact with smart contracts.

In standard ERC-20 tokens, if a user wants a smart contract to spend their tokens on their behalf, they must:

1. Call `approve(spender, amount)` - a transaction signed and sent from the token owner's wallet.

2. Then call `transferFrom(from, to, amount)` - which is often done by the spender (usually a contract). 

This 2-step flow requires:
- Two separate on-chain transactions.
- ETH in the user's wallet to pay gas for both.
- The user to interact directly with the blockchain, even if a dApp is mediating.

This creates UX friction, especially for:
- New users unfamiliar with gas and approvals.
- Users who don't hold ETH.
- Mobile / web-based wallet flows where users expect a single action. 

Example Friction:
Imagine a user wants to deposit DAI into a lending protocol. They must first approve the protocol to spend their DAI and only then can they deposit. This adds latency, cost, and complexity - and leads to a poor onboarding experience. 

### Limitations of Standard `approve()`
- Requires ETH: Even for basic approvals, the sender must hold ETH to cover gas fees.
- 2-Step UX: As mentioned, interacting with DeFi often requires both approve and then a function like deposit or swap, adding extra steps.
- Not flexible: Approvals can’t be batched or delegated easily.
- Message sender (msg.sender) bound: Only the token owner (EOA) can issue the approval, making smart contract wallets less interoperable.

### Benefits of Gasless Approvals
ERC-2612 introduces the `permit()` function, allowing approval via a signed message, rather than a transaction. This enables:

- Gasless User Onboarding: Users don’t need ETH to approve spending — a relayer or dApp can submit the transaction on their behalf.

- Single-Transaction Flows: By including a permit signature, a smart contract can call `permit()` and `transferFrom()` in one transaction.

- Off-chain Approval Logic: Approvals are now detached from msg.sender. This enables:

> dApp-native meta-transactions.
> More flexible transaction bundling and batching.
> Wallets to generate signed approvals without sending them on-chain.

- Wallet Compatibility via EIP-712: `permit()` uses EIP-712 typed structured data, which is already widely supported in:

> Metamask
> WalletConnect
> Safe (Gnosis)
> Ledger/Trezor
